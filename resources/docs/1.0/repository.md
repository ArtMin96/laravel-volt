# Repository Pattern

Getting Started with Repository Pattern in Laravel using Inheritance and Dependency Injection

---

> The Repository pattern. Repositories are classes or components that
> encapsulate the logic required to access data sources. They centralize
> common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and
> decoupling the infrastructure or technology used to access databases
> from the domain model layer.
